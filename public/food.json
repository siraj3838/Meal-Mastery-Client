        "recipeDetails": "Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish made with eggs, cheese, pancetta, and pepper. The creamy sauce is achieved by tossing hot pasta with raw eggs, which cook from the residual heat, creating a rich and silky texture. The dish is typically garnished with freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese and a generous amount of black pepper. This dish is a good source of protein from the eggs and pancetta, and calcium from the cheese. Using whole grain pasta can increase the fiber content, aiding in digestion and providing a slower release of energy. The simplicity of Carbonara ensures minimal processing, preserving more nutrients compared to heavily processed foods. Additionally, the dish contains essential vitamins and minerals, including vitamin A, vitamin B12, and selenium. The use of fresh ingredients and minimal additives make it a healthier choice, while the rich flavors ensure it is both satisfying and nutritious.",
